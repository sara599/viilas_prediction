## Villas prediction
**Data** :
The data used for this project was scrapped from OLX website. The data includes information on the location, size, and amenities of villas that have been sold in Egypt in recent years.

**Methods** :
The data was analyzed using NumPy, Pandas, and Seaborn. A variety of machine learning models were then trained on the data, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The best model was chosen based on its accuracy on a holdout dataset.

**Results** :
The best model was a XGBoost model with an accuracy of 97%. This means that the model was able to predict the price of a villa with 97% accuracy.

**Implications** :
The results of this project can be used to help buyers and sellers of villas in Egypt. Buyers can use the model to estimate the price of a villa before they make an offer. Sellers can use the model to set a realistic asking price for their villa.
